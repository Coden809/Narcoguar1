                    Our founder Stephen Blanford is no stranger to the opioid epidemic and all of the loss that it
                    carries with it, including loss of life and freedom. Having witnessed the devastating effects
                    firsthand, Stephen was driven to create a solution that could make a real difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's Stephen's goal to not only prevent any overdose fatalities in the near future, but also
                    transform the lives of those saved and as many as can be reached by helping people form community
                    ties, family and friendships.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  We believe in helping people earn an income, become financially independent, and providing support for
                  their basic necessities. Stephen has concluded that maybe a different approach towards recovery is
                  needed, and some of the most important things to breaking free from the chains of addiction are
                  founded in the "Rat Park" experiment.

                  This whole Narcoguard initiative isn't about moneyâ€”it's about saving lives and helping people really
                  live a fulfilling life with a purpose. Even if this saves one life, then it is worth it, because every
                  life is priceless.
